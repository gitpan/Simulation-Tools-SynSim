# This is the general template for the input data file for the OPSnet SynSim script.
# Conventions:
# lists of values for parameters are comma-separated
# lists of values for the parameters in a set of curvers are semicolumn (;) separated. The shortcut '..' is allowed provided that the values are integers
# When using more than one set, they al must have the same number of elements. THis is because the corresponding elements are combined. eg:
# _SET1 = 1;2;3
# _SET2 = 4;5;6
# This gives 3 simulations with resp. (1,4),(2,5) and (3,6).
# Lines starting with '#' and blank lines are ignored
# Lines starting with an underscore (_) are supposed to have following synstax:
# _NAME = VALUE1 [,VALUE2[,..,VALUEn]]
# The script will do a 'for'-loop over every parameter with more than one value. As a consequence,
# DEVTYPE can have only 1 argument.
# For every value of _SIMTYPE, the corresponding section must be present e.g.:
# bufsim3
# _SAMPL = ...;...
# Make sure the SIMTYPE does not have an underscore, otherwise it's considered as a parameter, not a value.
#
# The TITLE statement is not a parameter, it's just a title to be used in the reports
#
# Unix is case dependent!
